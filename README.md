# DesignOfExperiments
The purpose of this “Design of experiments” project was to maximize the distance that a Lego race-car can travel after going down a pre-constructed ramp. 
The race-car was built from a limited number of Lego bricks. Through the construction of this race-car, the distance was meticulously compared in order to find the optimal model.
